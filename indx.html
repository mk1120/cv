        Last midnight , I received one of my worst message in my life from you
        Binh. I felt really shock I think you do not want talk to me anymore, so
        I decided to write this letter for you. Hopefully you can read this till
        end , cause all words came out from my mind and heart . It will not
        waste you more than 10 minutes. Not the big deals, just my last messages
        for you Binh....
      </p>

      <p>
        In this morning,I wonder what the first date I know you, so I spent
        almost 30 minutes to keep drag the WeChat chat screen to top . Finally,
        I found it . It was <b>Sunday, 19 August 2018</b>. Actually I knew you
        even early , cause I can't find any records again on skout app there.
      </p>

      <p>Let me do some calculation till now:</p>
      <blockquote>
        from Sunday, 19 August 2018 <br />
        till Saturday, January 2021<br />
        Results: <span>896 days</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It is 896 days, seem you waste the time on me really long . During these
        days many things happened both of us , watch your niece from baby to
        little girls now. That we know time went really fast than we expected.
        What a waste! You might thinks our relationship has not future, maybe
        you are right cause I can not be with you anytime , we just can call
        through the phone as usual we been doing for these 2 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually I have planned to visit you again again again. Unfortunately,
        the pandemic spread out all over the worlds , till now the world still
        can not fully get rid off these viruses. Everyone can not go other
        countries easy like before. Maybe this is our fate , girl times are
        really important that I know very well .
      </p>

      <p>
        I will keep our chat history and pictures on WeChat there forever , that
        memory both of us from sweet moment to end of story. Otherwise I found
        the voice messages which you sent me 2 years ago sound like reading the
        books....haha that time your English bad . Those are all valuable memory
        for my beloved Binh..., "Binh""Binh""Binh", I really like to call your
        name sound like stupid word sound in Chinese. Maybe I get to used it for
        long time already , if in the future can not call you again . I might
        feel really weird and seem like lost something in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, I really think wanna marry to you then we can have children
        but imagine perfect reality really cruel. Unfortunately, we can not make
        it and the promises that I made can not be achieved such as the birthday gift, marriage , etc...haha.
        By the way, I remember one gift from you. You remember?
      </p>

        <em>It is the perfume. I think I will keep it to remind you.....KKK</em>

        <em class="movie-em">The First movie with you at cinema , love the movie title "Friend Zone".....KKK</em>

      <p>
        The last thing I can do for you , just let you go . I think you can find
        the man better than me and he will treat and love you more than I did .
        Finally I have last request , simple and easy just do not block me on
        Facebook . That is last connection between us, see your posts there and
        make sure you everything's doing well and happiness. If in the future
        the virus fully gone and I have trip to Vietnam. I will drop by your
        Hometown <i>Bien Hoa</i> there and ask you have a good dinner or coffee
        with me if you would like to.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any problem of life, need to share to someone. I will be your ears anytime.<br /> 
        When I looked back our chat history. I found some interesting. <br />
        Let see...KKK
